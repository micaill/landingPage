<h1>History of Benguet</h1>

<h3>Early history</h3>

<dt>The mountainous area now covered by Benguet is generally presumed to have been settled from at least the 14th century by tribes coming from the surrounding lowlands, lured by the abundance of natural resources such as gold, hides, and wax. Two of these groups, the Ibaloi and the Kankanaey, are dominant ethnolinguistic groups of the area. In the pre-conquest period, these tribes enjoyed flourishing trade with lowland groups immediately to their west and south, such as the Pangasinans. Governor Juan "Oraa" Cariño (1913-1918), one of Benguet’s governors, was the first Filipino governor.</dt>

<h3>Spanish colonial era</h3>

<dt>At the beginning of the Spanish Era, colonisers heard of the rich gold mines in the mountains and attempted to colonize the highlands, but failed. In 1572, Spanish conquistador Juan de Salcedo led a small expedition into the southern part of Benguet, but the natives forced it to retreat.[6] The first major expedition into the mountains occurred in 1620, when Spanish explorers went into the La Trinidad Valley, followed by a second expedition in 1623, and a third in 1624. This was the last attempt to occupy the Baguio gold mines by the Spanish until the Galvey expeditions (1829-1839).[7]: 473–475 

In the 1800s, Spanish colonizers made more serious attempts such as expeditions under Col. Guillermo Galvey[9]: 280  and succeeded in establishing a presence in the La Trinidad Valley, named after Galvey's wife.[6]</dt>
